Ramsay and Druckerâ€™s critique of Moretti is incorrect. They argue that Moretti treats his dataset as given, a priori, and unquestionable, rather than information whose metrics and values are open to question. This is a mistake. Digital Humanities methods must rely upon stable, unquestionable datasets because this is the only way that scholarship in the field can scale up. By examining established datasets in unique ways, digital humanities scholarship can advance provable claims about cultural phenomena over large scales of time and space. We must not question the assumptions used to generate datasets because scholarship requires valid data in order to answer big questions.
